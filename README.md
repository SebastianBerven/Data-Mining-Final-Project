# Data-Mining-Final-Project

All functions for the various classifiers are included in their respective files. However, to run any of them, only the first function needs to be called. This is done in main.py by importing in the various other files.

All of the data at various stages of cleaning have been included for analysis of different aspects of the datasets.

Some sample pictures have been created, but additional graphs can be created using Data_Visualization.py

To do any of the geo-mapping, the included Geomapping-Data-Visualization.zip file contains the files necessary to generate the graphic, as well as data to go along with it. It is too big to upload unzipped to Github, so to recreate the maps we made, the data needs to be unzipped and matplotlib's Basemap needs to be installed.
